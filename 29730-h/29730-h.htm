possessed of this book to read the recipes herein contained carefully
and thoughtfully before attempting the making of any of them, and also
to observe the following instructions:</p>

<p>Weigh and measure all ingredients exactly, and have everything ready
to mix before you commence.</p>

<p>If you measure your ingredients by means of a cup be sure you use one
which holds half a pint.</p>

<p>Use neither more nor less of anything than the recipe instructs you,
and be sure to have your fire just right, as also instructed by the
recipe.</p>

<p>If at first success does not come to you do not despair, but persist
in following the advice of the old adage: “Try, try again.”</p>

<p>You should always bear in mind that honest work is never lost and
that reward must come in the end.</p>

<b>Directions for Making Ice Cream.</b>&mdash; The implements needed are
a freezer, rock salt and finely cracked ice. Ice cream freezers can be
bought at any hardware store. They consist of a large wooden pail with a
faucet on the side near the bottom and a freezer with a paddle inside.
The cracking of the ice is best accomplished by putting it into a coarse
sack and pounding it fine with a hammer or mallet. Place the freezer
into the pail, put in the paddle and cover the freezer tightly. Fill the
space between the pail and freezer with fine cracked ice to ⅓ its
height, sprinkle over 2 handfuls salt and pack down the ice with a piece
of wood, so that it may be firm all around the freezer; continue with
layers of ice, salt and the packing down till the ice reaches to the
edge of cover; next pour into the freezer the mixture that is to be
frozen; but care should be taken not to put in too much, for the cream
needs plenty of room in order to become light and smooth; cover the
freezer and let it stand for 5 minutes; then commence to turn; after 10
minutes’ turning remove the cover from freezer and cut the frozen cream
with a long bladed knife from the sides of can; repeat this every 10
minutes until the cream is frozen hard; then remove the paddle, even off
the cream in the freezer, cover and let it stand for 10 minutes; do not
draw off the water from pail until it stands above the ice and the
freezer has lost its firm hold; after drawing off the water fill the
space up again with cracked ice and salt; when the 10 minutes have
elapsed fill the frozen cream into an ice form, cover tightly and paste
a strip of buttered paper around the edge of cover; then pack the form
into cracked ice and salt for 1 or 2 hours; when ready to serve take the
form from the ice, rinse it off with cold water, remove the

for its preparation is a butter tub or a large pail, some ice, rock
salt, a&nbsp;tin form with tube in the center and a cover that fits it
closely. The ice is best broken to pieces by putting it into a coarse
bag and pounding with a hatchet. By this process no ice is wasted and
there is no muss.</p>

use the exact quantity of sugar. If the mixture contains too much sugar
it will not freeze; if too little sugar the ice will be hard and dry.
The better way is to try a little of it before putting the whole mixture
into a freezer. If hard and dry add some thick sugar syrup; if it does
not freeze at all add some cold water or a very thin syrup of sugar.</p>

a wide kettle or saucepan over the fire with sufficient water to cover
the apples, let it come to a boil, put in the apples and boil till a

nearly cold pour the syrup over the apples and set on ice to get firm;
serve with whipped cream or vanilla sauce. Peaches, pears or quinces are
made the same way. Finely chopped nuts sprinkled over before the jelly
has hardened or freshly grated cocoanut sprinkled over is a great
improvement. Half these quantities will be sufficient for a family of

PIES.</a></h4>

<p><a class = "recipe" name = "recipe658" id = "recipe658">658.</a>
<b>Directions for Making Pies.</b>&mdash; To succeed in making good
pastry the following rules should be observed:&mdash;Flour should be of
the best quality, dry and sifted before using. Butter, unless fresh,
should be washed several times in cold water and dried in a napkin. Lard
should be sweet, and is best when tried out from leaf lard. If suet is
used it should be fresh, chopped fine and freed from all skin. During
the process of chopping it should be dredged with flour. Beef dripping
should be clarified, and if the dripping has any odor or by-taste a very
disagreeable flavor will be imparted to the paste. Strict cleanliness
must be observed. All utensils used for pastry making should be clean
and kept exclusively for that purpose. Prepare the crust as quickly as
possible and do not touch it with your hands any more than necessary.
When the crust is ready take a pie plate (agate pie plates are the best)
and dust it with flour; do not grease it with butter or lard. Cut off a
portion of the crust, roll it out thin, lay it over the plate, press it
down lightly with the hand, set the plate in front of you, press with
the palms of both hands against the edge of plate and cut the paste
which hangs over the edge off with your fingers. The plate is then ready
to receive the ingredients of which the pie is to be made. If pumpkin,
cocoanut or custard pie is to be made, brush
<a name = "page184" id = "page184">
<span class = "pagenum">184</span></a>
the surface of crust over with beaten egg and sprinkle over 2
tablespoonfuls finely sifted bread or cracker crumbs; then fill in the
mixture. This keeps the crust dry and prevents it from being heavy. Pies
that are made of stewed or preserved fruit should also be treated the
same way. For fine meringue pies the crust should be baked before the
mixture is put in. This is done in the following manner:&mdash;Line the
pie plate with crust and brush the edge over with beaten egg; then roll
some pie crust very thin, cut it into strips 1 inch wide and cut one
side of the strips into scallops with a knife; wet the edge of crust on
the pie plate with beaten egg or water; then lay the strip around the
edge of plate so the scallops stand a little above the edge; next lay
some thin, buttered brown paper into the plate all over the crust, fill
the plate with dry peas and bake it in a medium hot oven till crust is
done; then take it from the oven, remove paper and peas, fill in the
mixture and bake again till pie is done; draw the pie to front of oven,
spread over the meringue and let it remain in oven for a few minutes;
then transfer it to a cool place and serve cold. 1 or 2 quarts of dry
peas should be kept for this purpose only. They may be put away in a box
or glass jar and can then be used several times. If the peas should at
any time become rancid from the butter or lard of which the pie crust is
made, pour boiling water over them and drain and rub thoroughly with a
dry towel; then spread them apart on shallow tins and when dry put away
until wanted again. Instead of peas the pie plate may be filled with
pieces of stale bread, which can then be used for bread crumbs; but peas
are best for this purpose.</p>

<b>Rich Pie Crust.</b>&mdash; ½ pound flour, ½ teaspoonful salt, ½ pound
lard and ½ cup ice water; sift flour and salt into a bowl, add the water
and mix it into a paste; put the paste on a floured board and work it
thoroughly for 5 minutes, or until it does not stick to the hands; then
roll it out into a square about an inch in thickness; also shape the
lard into a square, but 1 inch smaller than the paste; lay it in center
of paste, fold the paste over and place it for ½ hour on ice; then put
it on the board again, dust it under and over with flour, roll it out 3
times as long as wide with a rolling pin, fold over one-third to the
center, roll over it once, fold the other end over that, so the paste is
three double, roll over it once with the rolling pin, turn the paste
around, roll it out again 3 times as long as wide, fold it up the same
way as before and set the paste again for ½ hour on ice; repeat the
folding and rolling twice more and let it rest each time for ½ hour;
when ready to make the pie roll a portion of the paste out very thin,
line pie plate as directed with it and fill the plate with the
ingredients the pie is to be made of; roll out another portion of the
paste, spread the top thickly with lard, lay the paste over the pie with
the lard side up and remove the paste which hangs over the edge of plate
by pressing against the edge with the palm of your hand; sufficient for
2 large pies.</p>

with a knife; put the yolk in the ice water and beat it with an egg
beater till it foams; then add it to the flour and mix it with the same
knife into a stiff paste; turn the paste onto a floured board and roll
it into a square piece about an inch in thickness; form the remaining
lard and the butter also into a square piece, but 1½
<a name = "page186" id = "page186">

inches smaller on all sides; lay it in center of paste, fold it over the
lard and butter together, first from right and left, then from and
towards you; lay the paste onto a plate and let it rest for ½ hour on
ice; then put it on a board, dust under and over with flour and roll it
out 3 times as long as wide, rolling always from you; fold over
one-third to the center, roll over it once with the rolling pin, fold
the other end over that, so the paste is 3 double, roll over it once
with a rolling pin, turn the paste around, roll it out again 3 times as
long as wide, fold it up the same as above and set the paste again for ½
hour on ice or in a cool place; repeat the rolling out and folding up
twice more and let it rest each time ½ hour; after the last rolling let
it rest 10 minutes and then use as directed; sufficient for 4 large
pies.</p>

<p><a class = "recipe" name = "recipe662" id = "recipe662">662.</a>
<b>Family Pie Crust.</b>&mdash; ½ pound butter, 6 ounces lard, 1 pound
flour, 1 cup ice water and ½ teaspoonful salt; sift flour and salt into
a bowl, add the lard and chop it up with a broad-bladed knife into the
flour until it is very fine; next pour in the ice water and mix it with
the same knife into a smooth paste; turn it onto a floured board, dust
under and over with flour and roll it out 1 inch in thickness; divide
the butter into 3 parts; put 1 part in small bits in regular rows all
over the paste; then fold it up, first the right side towards the left,
then the left side towards the right, so the paste has 3 thicknesses;
turn it around, roll it out again the same way, put over the second part
of butter, fold it up and roll out again the same way; put over the
third part of butter, fold it up and roll it out twice more; let it rest
for 1 hour on ice or in a cool place; then use; while the rolling and
folding is going on flour must be sprinkled under and over the paste;
the rolling pin must be kept floured, to keep the paste from sticking to
it. This paste may be made the day before it is to be used, and if it
stands for 2 or 3 days it will not hurt it as long as the paste is kept
in a cool place; sufficient for 4 large pies.</p>

hollow in center and put in the yolks of 3 eggs and ½ pound butter; work
this quickly with your hands into a stiff paste, adding by degrees a
little ice water; then roll it out 1 inch in thickness and fold the
right and left side to the center, so they meet together; then fold the
other two sides over to the center the same way and set it for 1 hour on
ice or in a cool place; when that time has expired lay the paste onto a
floured board, roll it out 3 times as long as wide, fold one-third over
to the center, roll over it once with the rolling pin, fold the other
third over that, so the paste has 3 layers, roll out again 3 times as
long as wide, fold it up the same way, let it rest for ½ hour and roll
and fold it up once more; then use. This paste is excellent for chicken,
oyster, pigeon or beefsteak pie; also for baked apple dumplings and fine
patties; sufficient for 1 large pie or for 9 apple dumplings.</p>

<p><a class = "recipe" name = "recipe664" id = "recipe664">664.</a>
<b>Puff Paste.</b>&mdash; 1 pound flour, a pinch of salt, 1 cup ice
water and 1 pound butter; sift flour in a bowl, add salt and ice water
and mix it into a smooth paste; work it thoroughly on the board with
your hands for 5 minutes, cover and set it for 20 minutes on ice; knead
the butter well in ice water, to remove the salt, and dry it in a
napkin; put the paste onto a floured board and roll it out into a square
about 1½ inches in thickness; press the butter flat, also into a square,
but smaller than the paste; lay the butter in center of paste and fold
the paste first from the right and left side; then from you and towards
you over the butter together; turn the paste over with the folded side
towards the board; dust under and over a little flour and roll the paste
out 3 times as long as wide; fold the lower third over the center and
roll over it once with the rolling pin; then fold over that the upper
third, so the paste is three double; roll over it once with the rolling
pin; turn the paste around, roll it out again 3 times as long as wide,
fold it again 3 double, lay it on a plate and set the paste for 1 hour
on ice; then roll it out again and fold the same way twice; let it rest
for ½ hour on ice; roll and fold it twice more, so the paste has been
rolled out and folded up 6 times; after the last rolling let it rest for
20 minutes and then use. The rolling out and folding together must be
done
<a name = "page188" id = "page188">
<span class = "pagenum">188</span></a>
with the greatest care, so the layers fit exactly over one another, as
the whole success depends upon this. The paste has attained its greatest
lightness when rolled and folded together 6 times; if it is rolled out
oftener it will loose in lightness; and if it is to be used where
lightness is not wanted it must be rolled and folded together from 8 to
10 times. Puff paste is best made in a cool place, and if handy on a
marble slab.</p>

<b>Short Paste (Mürber Teig&mdash;German art).</b>&mdash; ½ pound sifted
flour, 6 ounces butter, the yolks of 4 eggs, a&nbsp;pinch of salt, 1
tablespoonful sugar and the grated rind of ½ lemon; knead the butter in
ice water, to remove the salt, and dry it in a napkin; put the flour on
a board, make a hollow in center, put in the yolks, lemon, sugar, salt
and butter and work it quickly into a smooth dough with your hands; set
it on ice for 1 hour before using. Another way:&mdash;½ cup butter, the
yolks of 3 eggs, 4 tablespoonfuls cream, ½ tablespoonful sugar,
a&nbsp;pinch of salt and ½ pound flour; mix these ingredients together
the same as above. Short paste (or Mürber Teig) is used a great deal in
Germany the same as pie crust in America, and is excellent when made
right. A&nbsp;very nice pie is made as follows:&mdash;Roll the paste out
very thin, cover a pie plate with it (one which is not very deep), cut
off what hangs over the edge of plate, spread a thick layer of any kind
of fruit marmalade over it, cover with a thin layer of the paste and
bake in a quick oven; or bake thin layers of the paste the same as Jelly
Cake, and when done lay 2 together with jelly, fruit marmalade or
whipped cream between them. Another way to use it is:&mdash;Roll the
paste out ⅛ of an inch in thickness, cut it into rounds with a cake
cutter, brush them over with beaten egg and sprinkle chopped nuts and
sugar over them; bake in a medium hot oven and serve with wine.</p>

1 teaspoonful ground cloves, 1 teaspoonful cinnamon, 1 teaspoonful mace,
1 grated nutmeg and 3 pounds finely chopped apples; mix all the
ingredients well together and use; sufficient for 6 good sized pies. If
this mince meat, is to be kept for any length of time omit the apples
and fill the mince meat into glass jars; close tightly and keep them in
a cool place. It will then keep all winter. When wanted to make pies of
take 1 jar at a time and mix the mince meat with an equal portion of
chopped apples; line 2 pie plates with rich pie crust, fill them with
the mince meat, cover with same crust as directed (see Directions for

<b>Apple Pie, No. 1.</b>&mdash; Line a pie plate with crust as directed
(see Directions for Pies); pare, quarter and cut greening or pippin
apples into fine slices; fill the plate with apples, sprinkle over some
sugar (about 2 tablespoonfuls for a medium sized pie), cover with crust
and bake till apples are done and the crust has attained a delicate
light brown color. If the flavor is liked a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg
may be added. In the spring of the year the juice of ½ lemon squeezed
over the apples of each pie is a great improvement, as the apples have
lost a great part of their flavor. Apple pies are best when eaten the
same day they are baked. If they stand over till next day they should be
put in the oven for about 10 minutes 1 hour before serving. They will
then be as good as fresh pies; otherwise the crust is apt to be
tough.</p>

<b>Bread.</b>&mdash; 2 quarts flour, 1 teaspoonful salt, 2 teaspoonfuls
sugar, small tablespoonful lard or butter, 1½ pints lukewarm water, 1 of
Fleischmann’s yeast cakes. Break the yeast cake into a cup, add 1
teaspoonful sugar and sufficient lukewarm water to fill the cup, set it
in a warm place till the yeast rises to the surface. Sift flour, sugar
and salt into a bowl, add the lard or butter and rub it fine in the
flour; then make a hollow in centre of flour, pour in the yeast and the
remaining water, stir it with a spoon into a stiff dough, turn it on to
a floured board and work it with the hands and some flour until it does
not stick to the hands; return the dough to the bowl, cover and let it
stand in a warm place to rise. When the dough has risen to double its
size, butter 2 brick-shaped pans or use the crusty bread pans, dust them
with flour, divide the dough into 2 equal parts, mould them into loaves
on the board, put them into the buttered pans, cover and let stand till
the dough is to top of pan, place it in medium hot oven and bake 1 hour.
If the bread is to be mixed at night take only ½ yeast cake, otherwise
proceed the same as above.</p>

<b>How to Make Coffee.</b>&mdash; Coffee should always be bought in the
bean and ground when wanted. It should never be allowed to boil, as all
the fine aroma is thereby lost. The finest, quickest
<a name = "page247" id = "page247">
<span class = "pagenum">247</span></a>
and most economical way to make coffee is by making it in a bag made as
follows:&mdash;Take a piece of coarse unbleached muslin, about ⅜ yard
long and ⅜ yard wide, costing about 5 cents per yard; fold on the bias
to a point, sew it together in such a way that the bag has the shape of
a funnel and hem it on the top; then place the bag in the coffee pot;
let the point hang so that it does not quite reach the bottom; let the
top of bag lay over the outside of the coffee pot; then put in 1 cup
freshly ground coffee, pour over ½ pint boiling water and let it stand 1
minute; then add 1 quart boiling water and let it stand about 3 minutes
on side of stove; have ready the urn in which the coffee is to be
served, which should be well rinsed with boiling water, pour in the
coffee and serve at once; pour more boiling water over the coffee
grounds and let it stand on side of stove for a short while; then serve
the same way; the second coffee will be found nearly as good as the
first. If the coffee is too strong add more water; if not strong enough
add less water, as some like it strong and others do not. Another way is
to take 3 heaping tablespoonfuls freshly ground coffee and 6 cups
boiling water; grind the coffee as fine as possible; rinse out the
coffee pot with boiling water, put in the coffee and pour on enough
boiling water to cover it well; let it stand in a warm place for 5
minutes, but do not allow it to boil; then add the remaining boiling
water, let it stand for a few minutes and either serve in the same
coffee pot in which it was made or strain through a fine sieve into a
hot silver or china coffee urn and serve at once. This is also an easy
and economical way of making good coffee, but the first-named method is
the best.</p>

<b>Fine Mayonaise, No. 1.</b>&mdash; The yolks of 4 eggs, 8
tablespoonfuls salad oil, 4 tablespoonfuls white vinegar, 1 teaspoonful
salt, 2 teaspoonfuls sugar, from 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls French mustard
and ½ pint whipped cream or 3 tablespoonfuls condensed milk which is not
sweet; put the yolks in a small saucepan and stir them to a cream; then
slowly add, stirring constantly, 4 tablespoonfuls oil; when this is well
mixed add the 4 spoonfuls vinegar, set the saucepan in a vessel of
boiling water and stir over the fire till contents of saucepan begin to
thicken; then instantly remove and continue the stirring until

<span class = "pagenum">250</span></a>
cold; then slowly add the remaining 4 spoonfuls oil, stirring
constantly; next add the salt and sugar; then the mustard and lastly the
cream or condensed milk. This mayonaise is excellent if made exactly
according to recipe. These quantities will make a mayonaise sufficient
for 10 persons. If the mayonaise is not all wanted at one time fill it
into jelly glasses without the cream. It will then keep for some time.
The cream can be added when wanted for use.</p>

<p><a class = "recipe" name = "recipe847" id = "recipe847">847.</a>
<b>Mayonaise, No. 2.</b>&mdash; 2 eggs, 4 tablespoonfuls oil, 2

mustard, sugar and vinegar; beat the whites to a stiff froth and slowly
add them to the above mixture; stir in the cream or condensed milk just
before the salad is to be dressed. These quantities will make a salad
sufficient for 8 persons. If it is not to be all used at one time put it
into a small glass or stone jar (without the cream or milk) and cover
tightly to exclude the air. If kept in a cool place it will keep for
some time. When wanted for use add the cream. This mayonaise is both
cheap and excellent.</p>

<b>How to Prepare Lettuce for Salad and for Garnishing.</b>&mdash; Cut
off the stalks from 3 or 4 heads of lettuce, pick off all the decayed
and withered leaves, break the tender green leaves apart one by one and
remove the thick veins; put the lettuce into cold water, rinse well and
let it lay in ice water for ½ hour or longer; shortly before serving
drain the lettuce in a colander; then put it in a napkin, shake out well

salad oil and a little pepper and salt; add to ½ cup white vinegar 4
tablespoonfuls water and pour it over the salad; mix it up well with 2
salad forks, sprinkle over a little cracked ice and serve at once. If
ice is not handy the salad will have to be prepared without it, but it
adds greatly to the crispness of the lettuce. If you rub a piece of
garlic over the salad dish just before putting in the lettuce it will
give the salad a fine flavor without really tasting of garlic.
A&nbsp;small spoonful of sugar may be sprinkled over the lettuce if
liked. Finely shaved onions may also be added.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">268</span></a>
tablespoonful flour with a little cold water, stir it into a quart of
boiling water and add 1 cup vinegar; as soon as this boils put in the
artichokes and boil them till done, but not too tender; when done remove
them from the water and set in a cool place; when cold cut the

<b>Sour Jelly (Aspic).</b>&mdash; Soak 2 ounces gelatine in ½ pint cold
water 15 minutes; then put it over the fire with 1 quart good meat stock
and sufficient vinegar to give it a nice sour taste; add a few cloves, 2
blades mace and 1 bay leaf; stir this over the fire till the gelatine is
dissolved; beat the whites of 2 eggs till light and add the juice of 1
lemon and a little cold water; stir it with an egg beater into the jelly
and stir and boil for a few minutes; then draw the saucepan to side of
stove and let it stand 5 minutes; then strain through a jelly bag; or
turn a chair upside down on a kitchen table; then take a square piece of
unbleached muslin and tie a corner over each of the upturned legs of the
chair; set a bowl underneath and pour the jelly onto the cloth a little
at a time and keep the saucepan on the side of stove, to keep the jelly
warm. If meat stock is not handy dissolve 2 teaspoonfuls Liebig’s beef
extract in 1 quart boiling water and use it instead of meat stock.
Another way is to boil 4 calves’ feet till they fall apart; then strain
off the liquor, set it aside and when cold remove all the fat; boil the
liquor down to 2 quarts; then beat the whites of 4 eggs to a froth and
add the juice of 1 lemon and a little water; add to the broth sufficient
white vinegar to give it a nice sour taste; also add a little salt, some
whole pepper corns, a&nbsp;few blades mace, 4 cloves and 1 bay leaf;
stir in the beaten whites, continue stirring, let the contents boil for
a few minutes and let it stand 5 minutes; then draw to side of stove,
let it stand 5 minutes and strain through a flannel jelly bag. Pigs’
feet or the skin of fresh pork may be used instead of calves’ feet. Sour
jelly is used for garnishing dishes of meat and salads. It is either
chopped with a knife or put into small
<a name = "page269" id = "page269">
<span class = "pagenum">269</span></a>
fancy forms and when firm turned out and laid around the dishes with
cresses, lettuce or celery between. If the jelly is not dark enough add
a little sugar color (see Sugar Color). If the jelly is white it may be
colored green with green spinach color or pink with cochineal.</p>

<p><a class = "recipe" name = "recipe918" id = "recipe918">918.</a>
<b>Garnishing.</b>&mdash; The articles which are mostly used in
garnishing are:&mdash;Lettuce, cresses and hard boiled eggs (either cut
into slices or quarters or chopped fine, the yolks and whites
separately, and laid alternately in small clusters all over the salad);
or cut green pickles in slices and lay them in a circle around the salad
with small clusters of finely chopped beets and chopped eggs; small
girkins, capers, olives and very small, white pickled onions are also
used for garnishing. Another way is to cut boiled carrots, white turnips
and beets into fancy shapes, such as half moons, stars, leaves and
roses, with a vegetable cutter; anchovies are also largely used in
garnishing. They are freed from skins and bones and then rolled up and
laid in a circle around the dish with small white onions, pink
horseradish and olives or girkins.</p>

<p><a class = "recipe" name = "recipe919" id = "recipe919">919.</a>
<b>Horseradish for Garnishing.</b>&mdash; Remove the outside black skin
from a large root of horseradish and wash it clean; then shave it off
with a knife in long narrow strips so they curl up; color ½ the shavings
with prepared cochineal and leave the other ½ white; then use for
decorating dishes of meats or salads by laying it in small clusters
around the dish.</p>

<p><a class = "recipe" name = "recipe920" id = "recipe920">920.</a>
<b>Cocoanut for Garnishing Salads.</b>&mdash; Grate cocoanut and
sprinkle it over the top of salad. Especially nice over chicken, shrimp
and fish salads; also on potato, tomato and egg salads. Grated cocoanut
lends a handsome appearance to any salad.</p>

<p><a class = "recipe" name = "recipe921" id = "recipe921">921.</a>
<b>How to Use Icing.</b>&mdash; Over large cakes pour the icing by
spoonfuls near center on top of cake and spread it with a broad-bladed
knife dipped in cold water all over the cake as smoothly as
<a name = "page270" id = "page270">
<span class = "pagenum">270</span></a>
possible; set it in a cool oven for a few minutes, then in a dry, airy
place, free from dust, to dry. Some icing does not need to be put in the
oven, as it dries immediately, as will be seen from the directions given
in following recipes. Small cakes are dipped into the icing or into
glaze and then laid on paper or tins to dry. If the cake is to be
ornamented make a paper funnel as follows:&mdash;Take a piece of brown
paper, not too thick, or white tea paper 12 inches square and cut it
through on the bias in two pieces from one corner to the other; take one
piece in your right hand, the bias side from you, roll with the left
hand, the bias side towards you, and form the paper into a funnel; bend
the end where it closes near the top over to the inside, clip a small
piece from the end of funnel with a scissors and slip a small tube
inside it to the end opening; then put in the icing and bend the top of
funnel in all around the same way as ¼ pound tea is put up in those
small funnel-shaped bags; next press the icing down towards the end and
commence to squirt it onto the cake. The cake may be ornamented with a
border and a harp in the center, or an anchor or any kind of a pattern
that may be desired. Flowers and leaves may be bought at any
confectionery and pasted on with a little icing.</p>

<p><a class = "recipe" name = "recipe922" id = "recipe922">922.</a>
<b>White Icing.</b>&mdash; Sift ½ pound powdered sugar into a bowl, add
the whites of 2 eggs and stir 20 minutes; add a few drops lemon juice
while the stirring is going on; drop a little icing onto paper; if the
icing stands without running it is stiff enough; if it shows the least
tendency to run more sugar must be added. This icing is used for
ornamenting cake and serves as a kind of paste to stick flowers and
leaves onto top of cake.</p>

<p><a class = "recipe" name = "recipe923" id = "recipe923">923.</a>
<b>Clear Icing.</b>&mdash; Sift ½ pound powdered sugar into a bowl, add

tablespoonfuls maraschino, Madeira or sherry wine, kirsch, rum or
brandy; before this icing is put on cover the cake with a layer of
jelly; then put the icing over it and set the cake for 1 minute in the
oven; then set it in a dry place which is free from dust to dry. To make
pink icing add a few drops prepared cochineal or strawberry syrup.
Yellow icing is made by adding prepared saffron. Essence of lemon or the
grated rind of 1 orange may be used instead of vanilla flavoring.</p>

<b>Almond Icing.</b>&mdash; Pound 3 ounces blanched almonds with the
white of 1 egg in a wedgewood mortar to a paste, mix them with ¼ pound
powdered sugar, the white of ½ egg and ½ teaspoonful vanilla extract and
stir for 5 minutes; dip small pieces of cake into the icing; pour and
spread it over whole cakes with a broad-bladed knife. Hazel nuts and
walnuts may be used the same way as almonds, as can also pistachio nuts.

free from dust to dry.</p>

<p><a class = "recipe" name = "recipe940" id = "recipe940">940.</a>
<b>Spinning Sugar.</b>&mdash; Put ¾ pound loaf sugar in a small copper
kettle, add sufficient cold water to half cover the sugar and stir until
it is melted; then place the kettle over a strong fire and boil the
sugar to a crack (the 6th grade); add a few drops vinegar,
<a name = "page274" id = "page274">
<span class = "pagenum">274</span></a>
remove the kettle, dip it for a few minutes into cold water and let it
cool off a little; if the sugar is spun when too hot the threads will be
too thin and lumps will form; then place the kettle in a pan of hot
water, or on the side of stove, to keep the sugar warm; take a large
knife in the left hand and hold it out straight before you; take a
silver spoon in the right hand, dip it into the sugar without touching
the bottom of kettle and let some of the sugar run off from the spoon;
then spin long threads back and forth over the knife from right to left;
after a considerable amount of sugar is spun in this way take it from
the knife, lay on clean paper and spin the rest in like manner; when all
is spun form the sugar into pompoms, garlands, bouquets, etc. Half the
sugar may be colored with cochineal to a delicate pink. The sugar should
be spun in a place free from draughts and in clear and dry weather. This
sugar is used for decorating and trimming dishes.</p>

<p><a class = "recipe" name = "recipe941" id = "recipe941">941.</a>
<b>Boiling Sugar.</b>&mdash; Put 1 pound sugar into a kettle with ½ pint
water and let it stand for a few minutes; then put it over the fire to
boil; while the boiling is going on dip a small brush into cold water
and wipe off the sides and edge of kettle; the different grades the
sugar goes through in boiling are as follows:&mdash;1st grade, broad
run; 2d grade, small pearl; 3d grade, large pearl; 4th grade, the small
blubber; 5th grade, the large blubber; 6th grade, to a crack; 7th grade,
caramel; boil the sugar for a few minutes and dip the point of a spoon
into it; if the sugar falls in large drops from the spoon it has reached
the 1st grade; continue the boiling for a few minutes longer; dip your
first finger into it and press the finger against the thumb; then open
the fingers and if the sugar forms a thread between the 2 fingers it has
reached the 2d grade; after boiling a little longer dip in a spoon and
if a pearl hangs onto a long thread of the spoon the sugar has reached
the 3d grade; after a few minutes longer boiling take a little in a
spoon, blow it and if the sugar falls from the spoon in blubbers it has
reached the 4th grade; after a few minutes longer take a little of the
sugar between your fingers and quickly dip into cold water; if the sugar
can be formed into a ball it has reached the 5th grade; after a few
minutes longer
<a name = "page275" id = "page275">
<span class = "pagenum">275</span></a>
dip the finger into the sugar and then quickly into cold water; if the
sugar can be broken it has reached the 6th grade; then set the saucepan
in cold water; if it boils a few minutes longer it will have reached the
7th grade, or caramel. The principal care in boiling sugar is to use the
exact amount of water. With too little water the sugar will curdle
before it has boiled enough. If too much water is used the sugar will
have to boil too long and will turn yellow. It should boil quickly and
only for a short time. It will then stay white.</p>

<h4><a name = "spelling" id = "spelling">Spelling</a></h4>

<p>Capitalization in headers is unchanged. French accents were corrected
when wrong, but missing accents were not supplied, except as noted.
Errors in recipe headers were generally corrected only if the Index
had the correct spelling.</p>

<h5>Forms Used Consistently</h5>

<p class = "inset">
blanc-mange (with hyphen)<br>
Bunt (for Bundt)<br>
cocoanut<br>
compote (for compôte)<br>
Curaçoa<br>
gateau (for gâteau)<br>
girkin<br>
nudel, <i>plural</i> nudels<br>
omelet <i>except in French recipe names</i></p>

<h5>Variable Forms</h5>

<p>These variable spellings were left unchanged.</p>

<div class = "inset">
<p>arrac, arrack</p>
<p>Bartlet, Bartlett</p>
<p>fryingpan, frying pan (generally unspaced)</p>
<p>mayonaise, mayonnaise (almost always with one “n”)</p>
<p>puree, purée, pureé<br>
(all three occur, but “pureé” with misplaced accent is the most
common)</p>
<p>saucière, sauciere, saucere<br>
(one occurrence of “saucer” may be an error for “saucière”)</p>
<p>souflé, souflée, soufflé (rarely with two f’s)</p>
</div>

<h5>Form Depends on Location</h5>

<p>These words vary by typographic location: recipe header, body text or
index. Although some are obviously wrong (flau, veut, biroche) they were
left unchanged.</p>
